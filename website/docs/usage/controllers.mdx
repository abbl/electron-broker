# Controllers

Controllers are one of two ways of handling the messages, and returning the response to the client.
They're fully reusuable between any type of a process.

## Routing

By usage of `MessagePattern()` decorator we can create a route, that controller will use to handle specific **pattern**.

```typescript {6} title="ping.controller.ts"
import { Controller, MessagePattern } from 'electron-broker';

@Controller()
export default class PingPongController {
  @MessagePattern('ping')
  public getPong(): string {
    return 'pong';
  }
}
```

Optionally you can provide a **pattern** to `Controller()` decorator, and prefix each route with it.

```typescript {3} title="shop.controller.ts"
import { Controller, MessagePattern } from 'electron-broker';

@Controller('shop')
export default class ShopController {
  @MessagePattern('get-products')
  public getProducts(): string[] {
    return ['bread', 'rice', 'noodles'];
  }
}
```

Broker will perform concatenation with `-` symbol on both of the patterns. Therefore, this route will accessible on `shop-get-products` pattern.

## Registration

Broker object exposes the `controllers` property in its configuration,
that's where you'll have to provide a references to your controllers, to register them within Broker context.

```typescript {10} title="/src/renderer/index.tsx"
import 'reflect-metadata';
import { Broker, BrokerClient, BrokerFactory } from 'electron-broker';
import ShopController from './shop.controller.ts';

let broker: Broker;
let client: BrokerClient;

async function createBroker() {
  broker = await BrokerFactory.createRendererBroker({
    controllers: [new ShopController()],
    secure: true,
  });

  broker.start();

  client = broker.createClient();
}
```

:::note

It's also possible to register your controllers with built-in support of dependency injection, see Dependency Injection section for more information.

## Message structure

Each message sent by the Broker is wrapped into `BrokerEvent` object,
which contains all information required by Broker to correctly handle forwading them.
Let's have a look at it's structure:

<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent: "center"}}>

| Property |           Description            |
| -------- | :------------------------------: |
| type     |     `REQUEST` or `RESPONSE`      |
| eventId  | Unique identifier of the message |
| pattern  |          Target pattern          |
| data     |      Payload of the message      |

</div>

## Data

Accessing the `data` property of BrokerEvent interface is done through usage of a `@Data()` decorator.

```typescript {11} title="shop.controller.ts"
import { Controller, MessagePattern, Data } from 'electron-broker';

interface Product {
  name: string;
  price: number;
}

@Controller('shop')
export default class ShopController {
  @MessagePattern('add-product')
  public addProduct(@Data() data: Product): Promise<string> {
    return `Created product with name ${data.name}`;
  }
}
```

:::note

By writing your code in TypeScript, you can transform your payload
into argument class type by usage of ParamTransformerMiddleware.

## EventId

It's also also possible to access `eventId` property by usage of a `@EventId()` decorator.

```typescript {11} title="event-id.controller.ts"
import { Controller, MessagePattern, EventId } from 'electron-broker';

@Controller()
export default class EventIdController {
  @MessagePattern('display-event-id')
  public addProduct(@EventId() eventId: string): void {
    return `This message id is: ${eventId}`;
  }
}
```

## Custom decorators

Custom decorators are useful while working with middleware, that is injecting
custom properties into the `BrokerEvent`, as it provides you with the access to them.

```typescript title="type.decorator.ts"
import { createParamDecorator } from 'electron-broker';

const Type = createParamDecorator((options, brokerEvent) => {
  return brokerEvent.type;
});

export default Type;
```
