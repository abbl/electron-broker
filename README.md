# About

The broker was created as a part of a side-project, that was built on top of Electron, and its purpose was to reduce the boilerplate code that we had to write, to scale the application. By moving execution of certain tasks to different processes. I decided to make the code open-source, to benefit the community, and allow people to more efficiently code their apps, and overall improve the development experience.

By abstracting the Electron API, broker provides you with simple and well known syntax, to handle your messages. If you used Spring or NestJS before, you will feel right at home.
